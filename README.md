Course Descriptions â€“ Applied AI & Robotics Program
Course	Description

AI Programming with Python: Foundations of Python programming, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

Machine Learning Fundamentals:Covered supervised and unsupervised learning models, evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing techniques.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):Explored text analysis, tokenization, POS tagging, NER, parsing, and language modeling using Python NLP libraries.

Applied AI Projects:Designed and implemented real-world AI systems, focusing on media and business applications.

AI System Deployment:Learned to package, deploy, and maintain machine learning models using Flask, Streamlit, and Docker.

Capstone Project:Built the Sasha Payne NewsBot: a real-time NLP-powered news classification and analysis system with a user-friendly UI.




How to Run the Project

1.Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2.Download NLP resources and models required for your Sasha Payne NewsBot to perform tokenization, lemmatization, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords wordnet
>> python -m textblob.download_corpora
>> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

3. Train the Model
python train_model.py

4. Run the App
python -m streamlit run app.py
